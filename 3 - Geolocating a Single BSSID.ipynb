    "Finding  wireless networks can be done in a variety of ways. Which way you use depends upon what you are starting out with. If all that you have is the \"BSSID\" (AKA the MAC Address)  of the wireless access point, then  your free choices are limited. Here is an example of a BSSID:\n",

    "`DE-AD-BE-EF-01-02` or more commonly when dealing with APIs they are colon delimited `ED:15:BA:DB:AD:ED` \n",

    "http://wigle.net is another website that has the ability to convert a single BSSID to a location. Of the two sites, wigle.net  has much more data, but you must have a registered account to use the API. Additionally, in my experience, the folks at wigle are very aggressive about protecting their data (as we all should be). They will likely block our location's IP address if multiple people begin making queries at the same time. That said, they are very nice people and I have found they are willing to bump the limits on your accounts and ensure continued access if you simply let them know what you're doing after you get blocked.\n",
